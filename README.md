# Solve system of linear equations with integer coefficients in integer

This repo provides a solution for solving systems of linear equations with integer coefficients in integers. 

To use this project, provide coefficients of your system matrix and right-hand side as lists.

After solving the system you will be able to see both analytical solution and evaluate it at certain points.
